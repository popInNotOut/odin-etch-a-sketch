## Description

This is a etch-a-sketch web app implemented by myself that allows users to paint something.

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <th>Website</th>
    <th>Link</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GitHub demo</td>
    <td><a href="https://popinnotout.github.io/odin-etch-a-sketch/">github link</a></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>

## Usage

To color a cell, you can either:

* hover your mouse over a square (for laptop and PC users)

* clicking on a square (for mobile users)

<br>

### Notes

Additionally, you can do one more thing – change the dimensions of the grid.

* please note acceptable width and height values range from 1 to 50.

* each time you change the dimensions of the grid, the colored cells from your previous painting will be deleted.
